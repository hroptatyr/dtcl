FORMULA is of the form LHS ~ RHS [~ VHS]

LHS, RHS and VHS are sums of column numbers

The value hand-side is optional and defaults to right-most
column that isn't mentioned in the left hand-side or the
right hand-side.

  -H, --header          Header is present in FILE.
  --col-names           Output column names.
  -C, --cast=COL...     Cast COLs into columns.
