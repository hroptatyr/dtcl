Usage: dtmelt FORMULA < FILE

Streaming implementation of data.table's ?melt.

Unlike data.table we obtain id vars and measure vars from the
FORMULA which is of the form LHS ~ RHS.

LHS and RHS are sums of column numbers
(or names if --header|-H is present).
LHS is the set of id variables and
RHS is the set of measure variables.

  -H, --header          Header is present in FILE
  --col-names           Output column names.
